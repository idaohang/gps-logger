Version 1.0 (19. June 2010):
* Initial Release

Version 1.1 (08. January 2011):
* Bugfix: nofs_init scans the whole SD-card for 0x03 (ETX) instead of only
  the first sector -> Existing data won't be overwritten anymore (thanks to
  Ralf Fischer for detecting and solving the problem!)

Version 1.2 (18. July 2011):
* Bugfix: It seems that ETX wasn't written correctly. Because of this, the
  logger couldn't find a place to continue writing. This is fixed now.
  
Version 1.3 (29. August 2011):
* Bugfix: GPS-Module was set to 2Hz despite of comment saying it was 1Hz,
  now it's _really_ set to 1Hz
* Bugfix: The UART library produced regularly buffer overruns which weren't
  detected due to the 2Hz bug. This won't happen anymore (thanks to Bastian
  Wegener!)
